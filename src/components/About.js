      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h2>Polar makes bills easy</h2>
      <p>In King County, everyone has a voice. King County is the thirteenth largest county in the United States, so the decisions we make together matter for each and every one of us. Each vote matters, whether it's for bettering our roads, schools, city council seats, and more. </p>
      <p>Our mission is to shed light on King County bills to create a culture of civic engagement, interest, and community. We want to pursue civic education through laying bills out in readable terms, encouraging more people just like you and me to vote on things that otherwise would be skipped over. Weâ€™ve seen how important civic discourse can encourage others to take action on critical votes to build a better future for ourselves, and the next generations.</p>
      <p>Your voice is your vote.</p>
